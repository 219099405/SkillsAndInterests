<h1>SKILLS AND INTERESTS</h1>



<h2>REFLECTION WITH STAR TECHNIQUE</h2>
<br>
Situation:
I recently completed a tutorial focused on understanding personal skills, interests, values, and transferable skills. The purpose was to help me reflect on who I am, what I enjoy doing, and what abilities I bring into different areas of life, including but not limited to work or school.
<br/>

<br>
Task:
My aim was to gain better self-awareness—to figure out what I’m naturally good at, what really motivates me, and how my personal values influence the decisions I make. I also wanted to learn how to recognize the skills I’ve developed over time that could be useful in different situations.
<br />

<br>
Action:
As I went through the tutorial, I learned that values are the core principles or beliefs that guide my behavior—like honesty, creativity, or helping others. Skills were defined as the abilities I’ve learned or developed, whether through school, hobbies, or everyday life. I found the concept of transferable skills especially helpful—these are skills like communication, problem-solving, and organization that I can use in many different settings. I also reflected on my interests, which I learned can be described as the activities or topics I naturally enjoy and feel curious about. The tutorial included exercises that helped me list and categorize these things, which gave me a clearer picture of myself.
<br />

<br>
Result:
By the end, I had a stronger understanding of what matters to me, what I’m capable of, and what excites me. I was surprised by how many transferable skills I already have without even realizing it, and how my interests—like helping others or working with my hands—can shape the kinds of environments where I thrive. The tutorial helped me feel more confident in describing myself and in thinking about what directions I might want to explore next, both personally and academically.
